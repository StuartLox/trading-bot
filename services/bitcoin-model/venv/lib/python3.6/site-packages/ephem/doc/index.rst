Alas, PyEphem is deprecated
===========================

First, **don’t worry** —
PyEphem isn’t going to disappear!

It will continue to be available on PyPI,
continue to receive critical bug fixes,
and continue to run on both Python 2 and Python 3.

But PyEphem’s design has several flaws
that I did not know to avoid
back when I started designing it in the late 1990s
and early 2000s:

* Instead of offering a clear way for the user to specify units
  of radians or degrees,
  PyEphem uses the terrible and confusing convention
  that floats like ``1.23`` mean radians
  but strings like ``'1.23'`` mean degrees of declination
  and hours of right ascension.
  This has wasted many hours of programmer time and confusion over the years,
  is completely unnatural and at odds with how Python usually works,
  and can never be fixed
  because it would break all existing PyEphem programs.

* The API is also awkward because it is not functional.
  Instead of returning coordinates directly,
  ``compute()`` updates several fields on its object —
  reflecting how the underlying C library works, which I didn’t write.
  This makes a second line of code necessary
  to go fetch the coordinates from the object.

* PyEphem is difficult to release
  and difficult for many people to install,
  because some of its code is written in the C language
  and so a compiler is needed.

* PyEphem does not interoperate with NumPy
  and so is awkward to use in a modern IPython Notebook.

For all of these reasons, PyEphem might not be the best choice
for a new project.

Two Alternatives
----------------

As the principle author of PyEphem,
I — `Brandon Rhodes <https://rhodesmill.org/brandon/>`_ —
had often thought about starting over again
so I would have a second chance
to avoid the mistakes I made with PyEphem!
It was only in 2013 (thirteen years late!)
that I discovered an excellent excuse:
back in the year 2000, the IAU (International Astronomical Union)
had
`thoroughly upgraded how astronomical positions are measured <https://syrte.obspm.fr/IAU_resolutions/Resol-UAI.htm>`_
to allow much higher accuracy.
So a rewrite could serve two purposes!
Instead of simply rewriting what PyEphem did, but in better Python,
I could implement the newer standards of measurement
and deliver much higher precision.

Following the United States Naval Observatory’s free
“NOVAS” library’s C code as my example
(for which they
also maintains a `Python interface <http://aa.usno.navy.mil/software/novas/novas_py/novaspy_intro.php>`_),
I started writing a new library that I named “Skyfield”
with the goal of implementing the highest accuracy algorithms,
using only Python and NumPy,
behind a beautiful Pythonic API.
Version 1.0 was released in early 2017
and both I and a few other contributions continue to add new features:

`The Skyfield astronomy library <https://rhodesmill.org/skyfield/>`_

I recommend using Skyfield instead of PyEphem
if it’s possible for your new project to do so!
(The only thing missing at this point is predicting positions
from Kelperian orbital elements for comets and astroids —
though I hope to add that by the end of 2018.)

If you are a professional astronomer
interested in writing programs that interoperate
with those of other astronomers,
you will also want to consider Astropy.
While it is not as sleek as Skyfield —
it bundles many dependencies written in other languages
and was not designed for beginners —
it is a much more comprehensive toolkit
that is very popular with professional astronomers:

`The Astropy astronomy library <http://www.astropy.org/>`_

But if you want it anyway, PyEphem is still available.

What is PyEphem?
================

**PyEphem** provides basic astronomical computations
for the Python_ programming language.
Given a date and location on the Earth's surface,
it can compute the positions of the Sun and Moon,
of the planets and their moons,
and of any asteroids, comets, or earth satellites
whose orbital elements the user can provide.
Additional functions are provided to compute the angular separation
between two objects in the sky,
to determine the constellation in which an object lies,
and to find the times at which
an object rises, transits, and sets on a particular day.

.. _Python: http://www.python.org/

The numerical routines that lie behind PyEphem
are those from the wonderful XEphem_ astronomy application,
whose author, Elwood Downey, generously gave permission
for us to use them as the basis for PyEphem.

Installation
------------

Version **3.7.6.0** is the most recent release of PyEphem.
Consult the `change log`_ to see the new features!

.. _change log: CHANGELOG

The easiest way to install PyEphem on a Linux or Mac OS machine,
after making sure that “Python.h” and the other Python header files
are installed (which on Ubuntu requires the “python-dev” package),
is to use the pip_ command, like this:

.. _pip: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip
.. code-block:: bash

   $ pip install pyephem

Better yet,
you can use virtualenv_ to create a virtual environment,
and then run its ``pip`` instead of your system-wide one.
Then you will avoid having to gain administrator rights on your machine
before performing the installation.

If instead you want to download the Windows installer
or even the raw PyEphem source code,
you should visit the `PyEphem entry`_
at the Python Package Index,
or use the links at the top of this page.
